config EC_SOFTWARE_SYNC
	bool "Enable EC software sync"
	default n
	help
	  EC software sync is a mechanism where the AP helps the EC verify its
	  firmware similar to how vboot verifies the main system firmware. This
	  option selects whether depthcharge should support EC software sync.

config VIRTUAL_DEV_SWITCH
	bool "Virtual developer switch support"
	default n
	help
	  Whether this platform has a virtual developer switch.

config PHYSICAL_REC_SWITCH
	bool "Physical recovery switch is present"
	default n
	help
	  Informs vboot that a physical recovery switch is present

config OPROM_MATTERS
	bool "Video option ROM matters"
	default n
	help
	  Whether the video option ROM has run matters on this platform.

config RO_NORMAL_SUPPORT
	bool "Booting normal mode with RO firmware"
	default n
	help
	  Whether booting in normal mode using only RO firmware is supported.

config MOCK_TPM
	bool "Mock the TPM in vboot (TURN OFF BEFORE RELEASE)"
	default n
	help
	  Make vboot pretend that all TPM accesses and checks are successful
	  without actually talking to the TPM. This option can be used during
	  development, or when the current TPM is known to be broken somehow.
	  THIS SHOULD NOT BE LEFT ON FOR PRODUCTION DEVICES.

choice
	prompt "Type of nonvolatile storage"
	help
	  Where depthcharge should keep vboot's nonvolatile storage.

config NV_STORAGE_CMOS
	bool "CMOS"
	depends on ARCH_X86
	help
	  The nonvolatile data is stored in CMOS.

config NV_STORAGE_DISK
	bool "Fixed disk"
	help
	  The nonvolatile storage is stored on a fixed disk. The first fixed
	  disk will be used. To avoid unexpected behavior, there should only
	  be one fixed disk in the system.

config NV_STORAGE_CROS_EC
	bool "ChromeOS EC"
	help
	  The nonvolatile data is stored by the ChromeOS EC.

choice
	prompt "Crossystem data mechanism"
	default CROSSYSTEM_STUB
	help
	  The mechanism for passing data to crossystem.
